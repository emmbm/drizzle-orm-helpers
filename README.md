This is a collection of unofficial typescript-friendly helpers for use with Drizzle ORM. Provided
items include common SQL/dialect-specific values, functions, operators, and column types. Note that
most the work is currently oriented towards Postgres and that most "solutions" provided by this
package should be seen as provisory, in wait of being replaced by implementations provided
officially and with more stability through Drizzle-ORM package(s).
